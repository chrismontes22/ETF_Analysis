# ETF_Analysis
[Click to see catastrophic risks of my 2x Leveraged ETF's using SQL (ETF.SQL)](https://github.com/chrismontes22/ETF_Analysis/blob/main/ETFs.sql). Detailed instructions are here for using the file.

The purpose of this script is to see which days in the past my leveraged ETF's would have gone to zero. I am invested in four of the most popular tech stocks: AAPL, GOOG, META, and MSFT. However, I am not invested directly in the base stocks themselves, but am invested rather through 2x leveraged ETF's. What this means is that I am taking double the risks and double the rewards.

Given that these are mature established tech giants, I am confident in their long term prospects over five years. This is nice because I avoid short term tax rates. Much more importantly it allows me to be aggressive in companies that I, and many people, have confidence in. If there is a particularly bad day, I strongly believe in a bounceback. The problem with being at 2x however, is that if the base stock ever touches a drop of 50 percent in a single day (see the script for the results on how many days had 50% drops!), my ETF will drop 100% to zero, thus removing any chance of this comeback I mentioned earlier from happening. If the base stock has its comeback, the new price that bounced back gets multiplied by zero, because you cant make gains when you own zero of something!!! So it will stay at zero. It is important to reemphasize that these ETF's reset at the end of each day. In the script I refer to these 50 percent base stock drops as "catastrophic loss".
